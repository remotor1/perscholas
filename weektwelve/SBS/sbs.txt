// 1. Create a superclass called Car. The Car class has the following fields and methods:

public class Car {
    private int speed;
    private double regularPrice;
    private String color;

    public Car(int speed, double regularPrice, String color) {
        this.speed = speed;
        this.regularPrice = regularPrice;
        this.color = color;
    }

    public double getSalePrice() {
        return regularPrice;
    }
}

// 2. Create a subclass of the Car class and name it Truck. The Truck class has the following fields and methods.

public class Truck extends Car {
    private int weight;

    public Truck(int speed, double regularPrice, String color, int weight) {
        super(speed, regularPrice, color);
        this.weight = weight;
    }

    public double getSalePrice() {
        return super.getSalePrice() * (weight > 2000 ? 0.9 : 0.8);
    }
}

// 3. Create a subclass of the Car class and name it Ford. The Ford class has the following fields and methods

public class Ford extends Car {
    private int year;
    public int manufacturerDiscount;

    public Ford(int speed, double regularPrice, String color, int year, int manufacturerDiscount) {
        super(speed, regularPrice, color);
        this.year = year;
        this.manufacturerDiscount = manufacturerDiscount;
    }

    public double getSalePrice() {
        return super.getSalePrice() - manufacturerDiscount;
    }
}


// 4. Create a subclass of the Car class and name it Sedan. The Sedan class has the following fields and methods.

public class Sedan extends Car {
    private int length;

    public Sedan(int speed, double regularPrice, String color, int length) {
        super(speed, regularPrice, color);
        this.length = length;
    }

    public double getSalePrice() {
        return super.getSalePrice() * (length > 20 ? 0.95 : 0.9);
    }
}

// 5. Create MyOwnAutoShop class which contains the main() method. Perform the following within the main() method.

class MyOwnAutoShop {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Sedan sedan = new Sedan(60, 10000, "blue", 15);
        Ford ford1 = new Ford(70, 20000, "red", 2019, 5000);
        Ford ford2 = new Ford(80, 25000, "black", 2022, 6000);
        Car car = new Car(50, 15000, "green");
        
        System.out.println("Sale price of sedan: " + sedan.getSalePrice());
        System.out.println("Sale price of ford1: " + ford1.getSalePrice());
        System.out.println("Sale price of ford2: " + ford2.getSalePrice());
        System.out.println("Sale price of car: " + car.getSalePrice());
    }
}
